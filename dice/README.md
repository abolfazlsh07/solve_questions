# dice
Mr. Jalalian has a dice. This dice is a cube that contains 6 faces and on each face a number from 1 to 6 is written exactly once.
It is interesting for Mr. Jalalian to know that if we consider this dice in the form of a cube, the number written on each face will be placed in front of which number. In other words, he wants to know what is the opposite face of each number in cubic form. That's why Mr. Jalalian gives you the number 𝑛 n from 1 to 6 and asks you to write a program to print the opposite number of 𝑛 n.
